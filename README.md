## Architecture
Good News app is based on Modular Android app architecture. I was a newbie in using this architecture at the first of project, but after reading many codes and articles about this wonderful architecture I'm finally ready to develop apps using this architecture

## What you can learn from this?
- You can learn how to use Modular architecture in an Android project.
- You can learn how to apply Clean Architecture in an Android project.
- You can learn how to use Dagger in Android in general and how to use it in a modular project.
- You can learn how to use Retrofit in an Android project.
- You can learn how to use Epoxy for easier working with RecyclerViews.
- You can learn how to use LiveData and ViewModel from the Architecture Components.
- You can learn how to use Navigation from the Jetpack Components.
- You can learn how to use Coroutines and Concurrency in Kotlin.
